* For this agile project, we have an online Scrum board:
  * [Scrum board](https://scrumy.com/inf112gruppe4)
* We also communicate using Slack.
* We use bitbuckets bug tracker, "Issues", to report bugs when we encounter them, while playing the game.
* Documentation like minutes, diagrams etc. can be found under docs/ in our repo.


## Usage of software
---
* To try our software, either for development reasons and/or to try the program you can clone the project using git. You must have java 1.8 and maven installed.
Our team is using Intellij, and by using that, you can easily import this project using Import from Version Control.

* You can run tests using the Maven project, with the lifecycle point called test.

* To run the program, either, from IntelliJ, run GUIMain, or run package under Maven, open target folder in Finder/Explorer/Files
(depends on OS), and run the file inf112v16-g4-Poker.jar

* This implementation of Texas Hold'em allows the user to play a game of heads-up poker against an AI.
The user can set the preferred game settings and the game continues until one of the players are out of chips.
Later implementations will allow the user to create a multiplayer game and play against other human
players over the internet. This implementation will also allow for a user to spectate a table of players.

###Bug tracking
If you where to test the software, and experience bugs while playing, feel free to add it to our bug tracker in our
bitbucket repo, under "Issues". We use this feature to report bugs, and to assign the bug to whomever who can fix and/or
is in charge of that particular part of the program.
